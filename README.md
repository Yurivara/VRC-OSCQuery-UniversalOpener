# VRC-OSCQuery-UniversalOpener (Under Development)

<u>**Instructions are found within the Wiki page on this Repository.**</u>

Any and all commercial use must have some form of accreditation to this source (for example, a link to this repository).

This allows users to create and access endpoints for the VRChat OSCQuery service used to communicate over OSC to VRChat without having to use a router.

The aim of this project is to allow all projects in all coding languages to use OSC Query easily.

### What is OSC Query?
OSC Query is a service that allows you to advertise a port to VRChat to stream OSC data through. This allows multiple OSC apps to interact with VRChat at once without having to use a router. This can be useful in cases such as OSC Trackers and Face Tracking. Or Face Tracking and other applications.
